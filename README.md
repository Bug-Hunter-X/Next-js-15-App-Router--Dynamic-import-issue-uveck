# Next.js 15 App Router: Dynamic Import Issue

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior encountered when using dynamic imports within a component in Next.js 15's App Router.  The issue involves inconsistent behavior and potential runtime errors related to how the dynamic import is handled within the new routing architecture.

## Bug Description

A dynamic import, intended to load a component lazily, does not function as expected within the App Router. This might manifest as a runtime error, unexpected rendering, or other inconsistencies not seen in the Pages Router.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the `pages` directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
5. Observe the unexpected behavior.

## Solution

The solution involves restructuring or adapting the approach to dynamic imports to align with the App Router's behavior. The provided solution file demonstrates a potential fix and demonstrates ways to handle lazy loading components effectively within the Next.js 15 App Router.
